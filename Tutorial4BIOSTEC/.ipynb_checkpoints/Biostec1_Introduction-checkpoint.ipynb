    "\n",
    "- Biosignals (ECG, PPG, EMG, EEG) are noisy, non-stationary and highly variable across and within subjects.  \n",
    "- Deep learning can capture complex temporal patterns, but many implementations are ad-hoc and hard to reuse.  \n",
    "- Training large bespoke models is often computationally expensive and difficult to deploy in practice.  \n",
    "- NeuLib provides a structured, reusable and efficient framework tailored to biosignal processing workflows.\n",

    "\n",
    " - Provide a systematic methodology for implementing DL models tailored to biosignal processing.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Enable the training of new architectures from scratch while ensuring that pre-trained models are available for direct use.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Promote transfer learning by offering tools to extract, recombine, and fine-tune components of trained models.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Foster community-driven collaboration by making models and code publicly accessible for further development.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Minimize computational overhead by encouraging efficient training and adaptation strategies.\n"
